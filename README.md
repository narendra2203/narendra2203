- 👋 Hi, I’m Narendra

- ⚡ Fun fact: React JS, despite being widely recognized as a JavaScript library, often gets mistaken for a full-fledged framework due to its powerful features and extensive ecosystem. It’s like the superhero of front-end development – lightweight, flexible, and ready to save your UI! 💪😎
